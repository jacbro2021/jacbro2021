  <h1>Hi there, I'm Jacob ðŸ‘‹</h1>
</div>

I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and I expect to graduate in the spring of 2025. I am studying Computer Science and have a passion for programming and physics.
Most of the development I have done so far is mobile development (in swift/swiftUI and .NET MAUI) and also a bit of web development (NodeJS and Django). I am open to collaborating on innovative 
and interesting projects.
