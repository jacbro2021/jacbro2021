## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and I expect to graduate in the spring of 2025. I am studying Computer Science and have a passion for programming and physics. Most of the development I have done so far is mobile development (in swift and .NET MAUI) and also a bit of web development (NodeJS and Django).
